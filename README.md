## Hey, there!

I'm Helena and I'm passionate about continuous learning. I moved from Brazil to Finland to explore the tech world. With a background in architecture and project management, I bring a strong eye for aesthetics and a solid grasp of the bigger picture in the projects I’ve worked. I’m studying programming and problem-solving at [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en/), where the emphasis is on collaborative, project-based learning through a peer-to-peer approach. I’m currently learning coding in C, marking the beginning of my programming journey.

### Let's connect!
I’m super available and looking to connect with people with coding interests.
